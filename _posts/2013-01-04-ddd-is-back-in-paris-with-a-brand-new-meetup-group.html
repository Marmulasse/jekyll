<p style="text-align: justify;">The first DDD Open Forum of the brand new <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DDD-Paris/">Paris DDD meetup</a> was last night, hosted by <a href="http://www.arolla.fr/">Arolla</a>, and it was good to meet again after a long time with twenty-some Paris DDD aficionados!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://twitter.com/tjaskula">@tjaskula</a>, the organizer of this new group, opened the evening with a welcome introduction. He also gave many suggestions of areas for discussion and debate.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A quick survey revealed that one third of the participants were new to Domain-Driven Design, while another third was on the other hand rather comfortable with it. This correlated with a rather senior audience, with only one attendee with less than 5 years experience and many 10+ years developers, including 22 years and 30 years experience developers, and still coding! If you work in Paris, I guess you know them already…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was an open space session, so we first proposed a lot of topics for discussion with post-its on the wall: how to sell or convince about DDD, introduction on concepts, synchronizing between contexts…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://cyrille.martraire.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/photo-3.jpg"><img title="photo 3" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/photo-3-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We all decided to start with a walk through of the fundamentals of DDD: Bounded Contexts, Ubiquitous Language, Code as Model… It was great to have this two-way knowledge transfer between seniors and juniors, in an interactive fashion and with lot of questions, including some rather challenging and skeptical ones! There was also some UML bashing of course.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We concluded by eating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_cake">Galettes des Rois</a>, together with cider and beer, and a lot of fun. Thanks everyone for your questions and contributions, and see you soon on next meetup!</p>
